# Orientation-estimation-of-an-Android-phone-using-Sensor-data-fusion-of-inertial-sensor-data
##### This is a pet project to demonstrate my algorithm development skills in C++
#### Task 1: Extract the acceleration and gyroscope data out of the inertial sensors of an android mobile phone (Python). (11.1.2020) - done
#### Task 1a: Read in the measurement file in c++ - done
#### Task 2: Fuse both the acceleration and gyroscope data to calculate the orientation angle of the mobile phone (C++). This will be done using a linear kalman filter. (23.2.2020)
#### Task 3: Develop an user interface to view the results (8.3.2020)

Deadline: 8th April 2020
