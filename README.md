# Orientation-estimation-of-an-Android-phone-using-Sensor-data-fusion-of-inertial-sensor-data
##### This is a pet project to demonstrate my algorithm development skills in C++
#### Task 1: Extract the acceleration and gyroscope data out of the inertial sensors of an android mobile phone (Python) - done (DataExtraction.py). This file is carried over from: https://github.com/Pradeepcbk/Gesture-Recognition-and-controlling-an-automation-environment
#### Task 1a: Read in the measurement file in C++ - done (src/SensorFusion.cpp)
#### Task 2: Fuse both the acceleration and gyroscope data to calculate the orientation angle of the mobile phone (C++). This will be done using a linear kalman filter. 
#### Task 3: Develop an user interface to view the results.
